# Geant4-Plastic-Scintillator-Simulation


This project simulates an Hexagonal Plastic Scintillator and computes the total energy deposit by muons. It also creates a root file with information about 
the photons generated via scintillation and the energy deposition.

The program uses the method GetTotalEnergyDeposit() to calculate the energy deposition by muons. 
6 sensors located around de Plastic are simulated as well in order to catch the photons generated by scintillation.

To run the program, type "./sim " in the terminal if you are not using multithreaded mode.
If you are using multithreaded mode,modify the "run.mac" file, there, you can change the number of threads your computer can use and also the number of 
events geant4 will simulate(1 muon per event). Once you've done that,type "./sim run.mac" to initiate the simulation.Beware that visualization is only 
available if you are not using multithreaded.
